## Interpretability of deep learning for microscopic parasite image analysis

Deep learning, which played an increasingly important role in the recent years, has been also widely used to analyze microscopic images of parasites. <br>

To encourage more researchers to use deep learning technologies in parasitology, we propose solutions for the following two problems.<br> 

To tackle the problem of lacking public parasitology datasets, we publish a dataset, which to our knowledge is the first large-scale microscopic multi-parasite dataset, and include six types of parasites (Plasmodium, Trypanosome, Babesia, Toxoplasma, Leishmania, Trichomonad), and two types of hosts (red blood cell and leukocyte). <br>

Our multi-parasite dataset can be downlaod [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/4tnhbsh58c/draft?a=58f32edd-d920-49a2-b690-7eb8508400d9).<br>

We further interpret deep learning-based parasite image classification using Class Action Mapping and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping visualization tools.<br>
