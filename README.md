# Interpretability of deep learning for microscopic parasite image analysis


Deep learning, which played an increasingly important role in the recent years, has been also widely used to analyze microscopic images of parasites. To encourage more researchers to use deep learning technologies in parasitology, we propose solutions for the following two problems.<br> 


### Multi-Parasite Dataset

To tackle the problem of lacking public parasitology datasets, we publish a  large-scale microscopic multi-parasite dataset, which can be downlaod [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/4tnhbsh58c/draft?a=58f32edd-d920-49a2-b690-7eb8508400d9).<br>


Some Examples of our protozoan parasites:

### CAM and Grad-CAM for Classification Interpretability of Deep Learning


We further interpret deep learning-based parasite image classification using Class Action Mapping(CAM) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping(Grad-CAM) visualization tools.<br>

Code for Classification, CAM, Grad-CAM and Confusion Matrix can be download above.
